![am-i-responsive](./docs/images/am-i-responsive.png)

## To Do:

- Add variable hints (eg. 1,2,3 hints)
- Fix the footer issue; need footer for fade in
- Resize the hint boxes
- Create image for showing players how to play
- Complete and document the testing
- Complete the Readme.md

## Objective

- Create a magic square game where the user completes a magic square with a number of cells missing
- The game should allow the user to select the difficulty and sie of the magic square
- If the user is stuck, the game should provide a hint to the user
- The game should also track the score of the game



## Objective

A magic square of length and height of `root` n can be constructed using an array of length `n` of integers increasing by a constant `k`


In order to randomly generate a magic square, the following inputs are required:

- A sequence of n integers, with a fixed difference k between subsequent integers
- An algorithm for completing the magic square 

The De la Loubère (or siamese) method is proposed as the algorithm for completing the magic square.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
